    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list of coin denominations and an amount, determine the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount. For simplicity, we'll assume the denominations allow for an exact solution under all circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Greedy Approach**\n",
    "The greedy approach to this problem is to always use the largest denomination that does not exceed the remaining amount until the entire amount is paid. Here’s how you would solve the problem for 63 cents using the denominations provided:\n",
    "- Start with the largest coin and use as many as you can without exceeding the amount.\n",
    "- Move to the next largest coin and repeat until the amount is reduced to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Programming Approach**\n",
    "The greedy approach works for the denominations provided, but it doesn’t work for all denominations. For example, if the denominations were 1, 3, and 4, the greedy approach would fail for 6 cents. The greedy approach would use 4, then 1, and then 1, for a total of 3 coins. However, the optimal solution is to use 3 coins of denomination 2. This is where dynamic programming comes in. We can solve this problem using dynamic programming by following these steps:\n",
    "- Create a list to store the minimum number of coins needed to make up each amount from 0 to the target amount.\n",
    "- Initialise the list with infinity for all amounts except 0, which is initialised to 0.\n",
    "- For each amount from 1 to the target amount, iterate through all the denominations and update the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.\n",
    "- The minimum number of coins needed to make up the target amount is the value at the target amount in the list.\n",
    "- Return the minimum number of coins needed.\n"
